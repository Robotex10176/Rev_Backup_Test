# Math for Measuremnts:

tile size: 2 ft
diagonal length: root 8 feet or ~ 2.82

corner to center ball/cube exact: root 8 divided by 2 + root 8

or about: 2.82/2+2.28

corner to ball: 3.69 feet

or: 112.4712 cm

so about 113 CM

corner to center of lander: root 8 times 3

or about 8.46 feet

which is 257.8608 cm

so about 258 cm

corner to corner: root 8 times 6

or about 16.92 feet

which is 515.7216 cm

so about 516 cm

## Final Measurements (aproximate):

Corner to center ball/cube: 113 CM

Corner to center of lander: 258 cm

Corner to corner: 516 cm
